[{"pageContent":"The internet is ok if you look in the right places. It's also awash with nonsense. I'm just hoping not to contribute to the nonsense. I publish little essays, notes, ideas, images, or pretty much anything else I want to share here. This site started with mostly computer related ramblings, but I went elsewhere with it after I quit the social networks. I wrote a post about this website. The easiest way to quickly scan everything on it is through the archive or sitemap pages. Feel free to contact me if you have any feedback, questions, or just want to say hello. Thanks for the visit, 4/26/2023 David A. Windham Portland We recently traveled to Portland to visit family. I’d previously visited the city alongside Eugene and Salem some years ago and was excited to see them again. Since I had driven the McKenzie River Highway across the eastern part of the state to Idaho, we focused on the western Pacific coast traveling through the Tillamook State Forest 1. During our trip we had a chance to explore a good swath of the Oregon Coast Highway and we took a day trip to visit some of the early wineries in the Willamette Valley 2. We went downtown for walking, dining and shopping mainly in the Pearl district. We toured around the rest by car. We stayed in Beaverton and toured around there a bit taking a look at the neighborhoods, businesses, Intel, and Nike. We visited the Japanese Gardens and Aboretum in Washington Park 3. They were nice and quiet. Oregon is undoubtably a very beautiful state with a diverse geography and Portland is quite a unique place. Instead of the typical travelogue, what really spurred this essay was the fact that we had had the Portland Art Museum on our agenda, but we never made it. On my tours, I made it a point to hit the east side neighborhoods stopping in for lunch and using the city’s homeless encampment data dashboard for a grittier tour of the city 4. While circling the block to try and find parking downtown, one of Portland’s finest tried to wave us down and then punched our car while yelling obscenities at us. I was so ticked off, I just headed back over to the suburbs of Beaverton and went bowling instead. It’s a shame because I really enjoy visiting art museums. Portland has become a flashpoint. Most of it was brought on by the coverage of the federal intervention during the 2020 protests, but Portland has a long history of both far-right and left-wing groups 5. Antifa as most people might have heard about it in the U.S. was largely a reference to the first use of the word in the U.S. by the Rose City Antifa mainly in response to rise of the alt-right groups who had been gaining momentum in the area 6. During the first presidential debate with Biden, Trump bragged about sending in U.S. Marshals and started his whole skit which crescendoed with Antifa being reponsible for the Capital Riots. I am not going ad hominem on this because I think there is a deeper story. While driving through the Tillamook State Forest, I asked if anyone had seen the movie Sometimes a Great Notion based on the book by Ken Kesey 7,8. In it, Paul Newman plays a gyppo logger who straps Henry Fonda’s severed arm giving the finger to the front of his logging boat while union busting. It’s really a story about the rugged obstinance that still exists in the Pacific northwest and likely a remnant of the pioneer past. It’s worth a watch, Universal Films published it without a paywall, and I’ve skipped to that exact spot @ https://youtu.be/0zaYvGNLpzM?t=6759 Hank Pander died the weekend we returned from Portland 9. He won the 1961 Prix de Rome Silver Medal and created a significant volume of work. He considered himself an American outsider having moved to Portland from Amsterdam and having lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland during his childhood. I’ve included two of his paintings below. He painted several large format pieces on the 2020 Portland Protests 10. I’ve included a painting below from 2021 entitled Lament ( Siege of Caffa ) 11. The subject is about the Black Plague, the most fatal pandemic in history which created social, religious, and economic turmoil changing the course of European history. The bird mask and stick are associated with doctors who lined the mask with herbs to sanitize the air and used the stick to avoid contact to the disease. The Mongols used catapults to launch plague-infested corpses of the dead soldiers over the fortified walls of Caffa in what is considered one of the first acts of biological warfare. 2021 was the year in which Covid cases in the U.S. tripled and the US Capital Riots took place. Hank Pander – 2021 “Lament (Siege of Caffa)” – Oil on Linen 60×81 The images of rioting in Portland became synonomous with the social upheaval of the 2020 elections. There are numerous reasons, but here is mine. Portland is a frontier town and those towns like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle have a long history of social strife which I believe is related to them being some of the last of the modern frontier. They are also full of modern day explorers, some of whom unfortunately end up drug-addled and homeless. Gus Van Sant went to high school in Portland and one of his first films, Drugstore Cowboy tackled drug addiction 11. Social welfare and homelessness are a problem in Portland. In recent years, the pressure of competition for resources have driven housing costs and I believe that competition for resources is the primary catalyst for creating a boiler pot of extremism on both sides. The people of Portland are not just Portlandia. They’re more akin to the pioneer decendents of the Oregon Trail and the obstinant gyppo loggers in Sometimes a Great Notion. The competition for resources drives the extremes and is sometimes a catalyst for great art. The existing social strife alongside the effects of Covid just served to illustrate a darker side of human condition. On the flight out to Portland, my wife and I played a modern version of the game Oregon Trail 12,13 which I had grown up playing on floppy discs and monochrome monitors. Portland started its life as a pioneer destination of desputed territory of the British and still perfectly represents the frontier expansion of the United States. The game is all about surviving the grueling emigrant wagon trail to the American west. In my opinion, the reality of frontier wagon trail life still persists in some areas of the U.S. We died in the game from exhaustion and dysentary and had to restart it to finish on the flight home. Maybe next go round, I’ll have a chance to visit the art museum and see some of Hank Pander’s paintings.

Windham Artificial Intelligence ( Part 2 ) I previously wrote a quick essay about artificial intelligence1 in which I took a fairly skeptical viewpoint on the usage of the term and I was partially wrong. It happens. Although I make some decent points in the first essay, I made some updates to it and I wanted to follow up on it with some additional comments. And based on the potential, this will likely become an ongoing topic. The main change in my viewpoint came from using the Khanmigo2 bot available from Khan Academy. It clearly shows how powerful natural language processing can be for acquiring knowledge. I’ve always had the viewpoint that AI is essentially just a fake term for describing how programming is used to do something like play chess or search a database. My main focus was not on how we use these tools, but on the tools themselves. Even though I hinted at this when I started using the term a ‘second brain’3 to describe a personal knowledge management system, I wasn’t fully convinced of using the term artificial intelligence. Aside from testing Khanmigo, I learned to use the OpenAI ChatGPT-4 API against my own documents this morning. Here I am asking it some questions: I had previously only used AI with CoPilot for code completion and just toying around with LLMs ( Large Language Models ) for fun. Now I’m paying for them. The best analogy I can use to describe the ability to train models is to compare it to automotive repair. All modern cars already use OBD (onboard diagnostics ) and there are tools that can read these codes. Although there are some standards, each manufacturer can specify additional codes. The average automobile owner has neither the OBD scanner tool to read the codes nor the manufacturer’s code reference. Since automobiles have circuits like computers, the obvious first use of AI was for programming code. That’s where AI, using natural language processing and machine learning against large language models steps in. Now imagine if you could simply press a button and ask your car what is wrong and how to fix it without intermediary tools and steps. AI will be able to do this for almost all professional fields in the coming years since we use language for knowledge. I think my prior hangup with using the term intelligence is that it infers a capacity for awareness and not just knowledge. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is already passing the majority of legal, medical, and business exit exams. My wife is asking me to review her college student essays because she believes some are using AI to write them. I’ve never questioned the value of assisted learning using a knowledge base or other programming tools, but now that I’ve had the chance to apply the same AI tools to my own documents, I can clearly see a path forward for AI-assisted technologies in almost every field of practice. It’s not necessarily coming for your jobs, but it will change how you do them. You can either adapt or be left in the dust. While other people will fear what they don’t understand4,5,6,7, I’m all in. The most practical application for me will be feeding databases and files into training models so that I can improve the typical little help bot feature to be able to process more robust natural language queries. I don’t think I’ll be building or training the models for machine learning, but in the tradition of John Henry8, I’ll still try give it my best to ‘out-intelligence’ them. John Henry said to his captain, “A man is nothing but a man, But before I let your steam drill beat me down, I’d die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord, I’d die with a hammer in my hand.” 23/04/26 – I saw a press piece recently citing a paper that had studied the sources used in AI and guess what? The AI is me… 0.00002% or 24,000 tokens.

Windham Life As We Know It The domain LifeAsWeKnowIt.com is now hosted on this server1. During the migration of the last server2, I found that the domain was already pointed to one of my new IP addresses when checking the server logs. Instead of blocking it, I just made a virtual host to capture those requests referencing the original web site and other disambiguations. I emailed the owner of the domain to confirm and the process got me to thinking more about the term. It’s an interesting phrase that has been used for books, movies, albums, television series, and other titles. I think what’s interesting about it is that defining life has perplexed science, religion, and philosophy. Since there is no consensus on a definition of life, it’s only descriptives of how we interpret it. Life is a process and hundreds of definitions of life have been compiled3. I also happened to watch a recent episode of The Simpsons last night entitled “Bartless” ( #743 Season 34, Episode 15 ) that uses the ‘what if’ our lives had been inextricably altered. In this case, it was life without Bart and was written by John Frink, the character Professor Frink is named after4,5. And so I think that life as we know it can only be described as “Oh my god particle mw-hai, hoyvin glavin”! https://LifeAsWeKnowIt.com Woozie – https://davidawindham.com/woozie/ Life – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life John Frink – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frink Professor Frink – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Frink 2/26/2023 David A. Windham Woozie I migrated the server this site sits on last week and said goodbye to one of my longest-running servers alongside of my favorite provider. And although this likely means very little to some of you, I take a good bit of pride in my approach to maintaining servers. I named the new server Woozie after a former pet like I always do1. I enjoy sys-admin’ing. I like the security aspects, monitoring the logs, automating various processes, and seeing how small a memory footprint I can run. Or perhaps it’s just the egomaniac power of being the root user. I’ve set up a bunch of servers over the years and every time I spin up a new server, I always learn something new and get a little better at it. The internet is like a giant neighborhood and I’m just trying to keep my yard tidy. I got the basics rolling to migrate and watched the server logs closely. There were 27 reboots, hundreds of lines of configuration changes and 82,145 requests served last week. The webserver is doing 10,000 requests at about 500 per second, 2.5 milsec per, in about 20 seconds ( see video below ). Linode2, my provider on this machine was acquired by Akamai3 last year for $900 million. I was and still am, as of now, an avid Linode supporter. It was just something about the little old bank building in Philidelphia that made them feel like an underdog. Akamai is in Cambridge Mass, the closest thing to an east coast silicon valley, sitting right up under MIT just like Google and Microsoft. The transition has been smooth thus far and I can only hope that they’ll give me the ability to easily plug into their existing edge network with some build tools4. Back when I first started making websites, I used an assortment of low-level hosting providers before working my way up the food chain. I’ve since worked on variously flavored machines across the spectrum of providers. I prefer to just admin the servers hourly so I don’t feel like a petty middleman hosting dealer. I have a distaste for constantly revisiting documentation so the cloud infrastructure at AWS and Google can be tiresome for most projects. I still like root access even for noSQL, flat files, or an external API data source. I like the ability to monitor all of the server and end-user traffic. There are definitely benefits to serverless edge networks and decoupled computing instances, but I’ve found that serving up an assortment of sites with mostly regional appeal doesn’t warrant the effort, complexity, or price tag. But let’s be clear on this since the term serverless is making the rounds… there are still mostly Linux servers underneath them all, you’re just not in control of them. Cloud systems can still be private and function like the big providers using orchestration tools like Kubernetes6. My service provider for this migration offers a managed Kubernetes product that’s relatively easy to use. Companies that once were trying to get you in their cloud are now offering racks-as-a-service. The key to using orchestration tools is having standardization between deployments. Even Chick-fil-A restaurants now have on-site computers Kubernetes7. I don’t use middleware to admin servers unless I have to on the provider side. I strip it down to the bare minimum so that it’s easier to keep running for a long time. I’ve got a couple web UIs to quickly scan logs and search databases. I remove all password access to users, obfuscate the default ports, lockdown the others with iptables, and run blocks at the webserver level. Aside from some of the default Linux packages, I use a couple languages, a couple databases, webservers, and some tools to restart other processes. I learned a lot new stuff about logrotate.d and cron as I tried to automate some new tasks. The deprecated server had been running at Linode for almost ten years. Not necessarily on the same hardware because I’m sure that the data center moves them around as necessary. It started off running Ubuntu Server v14.04 back in 2014 and I ran it up until v18.04 which is running into an End of Life this April. I upgraded it to v20.04 and could have kept it going much longer, but I was getting tired of cleaning out the cruft and customizing outdated packages. Plus, I just wanted a clean slate on the configuration on a new development server. Simple is the key to my approach. If I don’t need it, I remove or block it. I’ve documented the entire server setup @ https://davidawindham.com/til/docs/computers/woozie8.

Windham Grocery Shopping I went grocery shopping this morning. It could be that I was thinking about food because I had an upset stomach from the spicy pork ramen I had yesterday out of town. I usually try to slide into the grocery stores very early on Tuesday mornings since it seems quiet, but I couldn’t get away from my desk this week. I shop at Publix1 and Lidl2 weekly and hit Trader Joe’s3 and/or Whole Foods4 about every other month since they’re a 45-minute drive. I think we spend $200 per week and my wife says $300 so I’m sure it’s somewhere between the two. Sources indicate that we’re not exactly on the thrifty side with the average for two coming in at $800 per month in 2022. Since I spent the majority of last week analyzing technical workflows, I just kinda wanted to tune up my grocery get’n game and share how I do it. Before I left this morning, I asked the better half to do the list. She still keeps a whiteboard and markers on the fridge and in the mud room while I keep a shared running Notes ( Apple )5 document using clickable task lists and sections. You just tap the items you need and they sort themselves so it’s easy to have em up on your phone in the store. Here’s that list from the past couple of months sans household and medicine items: ProduceCoolerPantry Freezer– Garlic– Beef– Honey– Pizza– Spinach– Shrimp– Coffee– Frozen Bananas– Asparagus– Chicken– Tea– Palak paneer– Tomatoes– Cheese– Oil– Ice Cream– Onion– Vegan Meat – Sunflower Oil– Lasagna– Lemons– Yogurt – Olive Oil– Fish– Avocados– Butter – Sesame– Burritos– Blueberries– Keifer– Mustard– Beyond Sausage– Romaine– Beer– Mayo– Tuna Burgers– Brussel sprouts– Milk– Dressing– Pinapple– Cucumbers – Oat– Pickles– Salmon Burgers– Broccoli – Almond– Olives– Paella – Oranges – Cow– Artichoke– French fries– Peppers – Soy– Pasta Sauce– Calamari– Green Onion– Juice– Mac & Cheese– Shrimp– Cilantro – Cherry– Pasta– Scallops– Lemongrass – Cranberrry– Oatmeal– Pad Thai– Basil – Grapefruit– Cereal– Enchilladas– Carrots– Biscuits– Peanut butter– Quinoa blend– Celery– Cheese– Chocolate– Corn– Ginger – Swiss– Crackers– Peas– Bean sprouts – Cheddar– Granola Bars– Plantains– Sprouts – Parmesan– Bread– Pieriogis– Mixed greens– Salsa– Curry– Blueberries– Bananas– Fish– Chips– Potatoes – Salmon– Rice– Apples – Cod– Quinoa– Lime – Tuna– Canned Soup– Mushrooms – Haddock – Chili– Green Beans – Orange Roughy– Canned Beans– Carrots– Eggs – Black– Nuts– Sigis – Garbanzo – Cashew– Tofu – Kidney – Almond – Peas – Sunflower– Canned Fish – Pistachios Not too shabby… you are what you eat. I was at a friends house last weekend out of town who I hadn’t seen in a while and I asked if I could look through his fridge and pantry for exactly this reason. I was at my mom’s last week and complained about her shopping habits as it’s related to health. Aside from sleeping, eating and cooking is coming in right behind work being done to pay for those groceries. I love food and we like to cook, so we rarely dine out. I asked my doctor once why, when I eat healthy and exercise regularly do I seem to gain weight to which he said “because you’re getting old and you probably eat too much” gently explaining portion control. I’m not a food snob nor a slouch. I like how good food makes me feel. I’m experienced enough to know decent cuisine and lowbrow enough to eat a deer perlo that my drunk neighbor had been simmering for two days. I got my first bag of Hot Takis on the road last week. I liked em. I occasionally drink a glass of wine or beer with dinner. I try to order directly from the vintner or brewer whenever possible and I’ll do the same with my food given the option. I noticed during the height of Covid that we were eating differently mainly because we were not shopping in person or ordering online. If you order in advance or go into the store with a list, you tend to think differently about your food. I’m not so organized that I plan meals or take the instant fun out of haphazardly grocery shopping. We have an outdoor market in town, but the vendor selection is still rather limited especially out of season. I’ve noticed that some of the products in Lidl are the same as Trader Joes’ and the prices aren’t far off from one another. I’d say that over half of most grocery stores are just plain shite. Corn syrup, puffed, flaked, canned, bagged premade shite. And I’d imagine that at least 80% of them are coming from just about ten companies. For whatever reason, grocery shopping makes me feel like I’m doing something right. Like the basis of all survival is hunting and gathering at my LED-lit big metal building with a vague music selection and lots of folks moving stuff around. Although it’d be nice to imagine the farm to mid-week outdoor market meeting my food needs, it’s not. The American supermarket is an icon of postmodernism… the Warhol soup cans or the ending credits of White Noise6.

Windham Human Updates Available I keep a list of short, middle, and long-term reminders on all of my devices that I use regularly1. Although I’m constantly editing the short-term list and the long-term has items that have been on there for years. The middle list seems to always have items that take longer than a couple of days because I’m not getting paid or rewarded for doing them. For instance, there’s one titled ‘Garage Floodlight’ because I needed some extra light in the yard when I was taking our dog outside in the evenings. I bought the wiring, fixtures, and switches to install I just haven’t carved out a weekend to make it happen. Another item on my middle-term list is upgrading one of my servers to the more recent version of Linux. I have this shuffling technique I’ve been using over the years with servers, software, and programming languages where I like to keep three tiers in running. I always keep one running way out in front on a beta version, one on the current long-term support version, and then there is usually one that needs to be updated usually because it has some legacy feature requiring a rewrite. This is exactly how I handle my servers so that I can shuffle applications between them as needed. I’ve been calculating some time near the beginning of this year to spend on upgrading and it’s got me thinking that I should be applying that same approach to my own knowledge and skillset on occasion too. It’s time to dust out some useless brain cells to try and pack in some new information. Just reformat, pile in some new architecture, and reboot I’m generally a late adopter2 because I like the comfort of the middle and I joke in my Github bio that I “still haven’t learned Rust”3. Although I kinda enjoy being able to work in a bunch of frameworks as the master of none, during the last several years I’ve found myself using just several stacks to accomplish anything with the vast majority of my code being copied and pasted from project to project. Because I’m focused mostly on smaller-scale projects, I don’t have to dive into machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science visualizations. I’ve got enough programming chops, cloud and network security experience to bring a project to scale, but it’s rarely needed. I understand and enjoy them, I just don’t have any real motive to acquire and analyze large data sets or scale a project to millions of users. And when I say motive, I generally mean money. A lot of folks may not realize it, but the underlying motives for many technology decisions are money in the form of security, network, and energy usage. Users generate revenue either through advertising, subscriptions, or purchases. Serving up quadrillions of lines of code hourly to billions of users takes energy in the form of electricity sent to computers for processing power. Optimizing how efficient and secure the code is saves money in the form of maintenance, energy, and network usage. Programming languages are only being used to make calculations and database modifications, databases are being abstracted in APIs to reduce calls, file formats for media have shifted to the most efficient and graphics have moved to being served in line with code. For instance, when a page from say Facebook is loaded into your app or browser they’re generally using JavaScript to query and pull in information that is changing from an API so that it is efficient. Their React library to do so has become one of the most dominant in web development. I’ve built most of my career on JavaScript and I can empathize with those trying to take in all of the frameworks today. Even a very simple website developer has to have a pretty robust understanding to customize the editors in the most common content management systems. It’s pretty difficult to keep up. Recently Shopify acquired Remix4 for React and Vercel announced a new build tool called Turbo5 that is built in Rust6. Although seemingly large changes have taken place since I started in the early 2000s, the basic underlying browsers have remained the same up until 2020 when WebAssembly7 (WASM) became the fourth officially supported browser language behind HTML, CSS, and JavaScript8. JavaScript is going anywhere and will likely keep its spot on the front end, it’s just that web assembly is much faster and safer allowing lower-level programming languages like C, GoLang, and Rust to work in the browser at near-native efficiency. The reason that Rust is picking up steam against the others is that it’s memory safe. I’d venture to say that the vast majority of the hacking out there starts with memory leaks. I’m going to have to dive into WASM sooner than later. And without any client motivation, I’m just going to have to invent a project or dive into someone else’s so that I can learn to find uses for it. I think I’ll start with the Rust WASM9 and Black Hat Rust10. So aside from packing that new information in, I think I’ll also add a permanent middle-term reminder that there are human upgrades available. Although there may be various reasons why I’ve been relatively successful in my professional life, I think the core is that I enjoy learning and adapting to changes. It’s an approach that can be applied not only to your profession but also to your personal development. We’re upgradeable in so many other ways than just our professional life… just pile in some new architecture and reboot.

Windham 2022 in Review It seems that about his time every year, I’m looking to clean up, put a nice little bow on it, and start the new year fresh. I’m trying to get ahead of the little bit of traveling we do for the holidays. In the process, I just re-read the last year-end essay I wrote in 20191. I think a year in review post would make a good tradition and an easy way for me to share with others. And in that regard, I’ll try to keep it brief. 2022 started bumpy with my brother, our dog, and Ginny’s grandmom all dying within the span of a couple of months. That put me in just a general fog of reconciliation and reminiscing for the first part of the year2,3,4. I gained the most from those events to grow as a person. I could go on here at great lengths about this, but the most important aspect I was reminded of is that the life we know is fleeting. I’ve always kinda felt that way, but it’s nice to have a reminder every so often to keep your priorities in perspective. By midyear, I was back to joking about it. I’d finish lunch or tennis with someone and say “If I don’t ever see you again, it was nice knowing you” which got some interesting looks and responses, especially from the older folks. We skipped our normal winter getaway likely because we were just tired from dealing with those but I made up for it on a couple of other trips in the spring. I got a cabin up in the hills with some old friends which spurred on a couple of other gatherings and potentially an annual event5,6. I saw Dylan for the first, and likely last time7. I went to see an old friend whose outdoor concert got canceled from lightning, so we just got to hang out. We also did a couple of tennis tournaments and participated in my first cycling event. Being around kind people in really nice environments is a great reminder of how fun life can be. Work this year was dominated by relatively short contracts. This is rewarding because I get quick positive feedback on them, but I don’t enjoy shifting my attention around. That’s likely why I wrote two essays8,9 on staying organized and it could be why I almost ended up in another full-time position. I replied to a recruiter’s email and ended up in a month-long interview process. I remember a long pause from the hiring manager right after I said something to the extent of “I need to have some flexibility with my schedule because I like to play tennis in the mornings and I coach tennis in the afternoons”. Needless to say, I talked myself out of a six-figure salary which, although seemingly impractical, will likely work out for the best. Ginny is simultaneously taking on a new leadership role and finishing a doctorate program at Clemson10. She will be defending and graduating next summer. I’ve tried to spend some extra time with my parents this year because they won’t live forever. I discovered the rewards of coaching kids after I became the head coach of the high school tennis teams. I finally ditched my old truck since the transmission was going and got a new ride11. I’ve also accepted that I need to carry my reading glasses into the grocery store so I can read the expiration dates. I spent part of this year on a vegan diet until the cheese cravings kicked in. And like every other new year’s resolution, I’d like to prioritize my mind and body the best I’m able to compensate for the aging. I’m starting the new year by turning 50 which I’ve been saying I was for some time now12. I’m not planning a party because, in my mind, I’m not over the hill quite yet even though I’m getting close. I couldn’t convince the better half to let me rehab an old classic convertible but I did get permission to turn our den into a studio so I’d like do some of the woodworking for the cabinetry, re-learn the piano, and take up watercolor painting. I am planning on doing the deep dive on the Rust and Web Assembly early next year to keep up to date with work. I think my boy’s tennis team will have a winning season this spring. Ginny and I are planning on remodeling the kitchen later in the fall and we’ll likely take a long break post-graduation to stroll up the west coast to celebrate her hard work. Otherwise, I’m just going to try and make it long enough to write another one of these next year. Best wishes to y’all out there and I hope you have a happy new year. Be well, do good work, & keep in touch13 , David 2019 in Review – https://davidawindham.com/2019-2/ Kristopher Roland Windham – https://davidawindham.com/kristopher-roland-windham/ Zeke – https://davidawindham.com/zeke/ Old Photos – https://davidawindham.com/old-photos/ Jocassee – https://davidawindham.com/jocassee/ Cold Mountain – https://davidawindham.com/cold-mountain/ Bob Dylan – https://davidawindham.com/bob-dylan/ Slow Thinking – https://davidawindham.com/slow-thinking/ A Second Brain – https://davidawindham.com/a-second-brain/ Gast, G.

Windham Twitter I logged in the first time soon after it started in 2007. I did my ten years and then mostly logged off by 2017. I’m not likely to start using it again regularly although I still use it occasionally as a people bookmarking service of sorts. I logged in last week to get an ‘archive’ of all of my data and publish it elsewhere1,2. I tweeted 828 times and based on the IDs in the data, I’m guessing that I was the 950,535th person to ever tweet. The process felt achingly familiar3. I’ve had some discussions with others about it recently and it reminds me to think about how I use the web. Per the course… I like to flush it out, write it down, and publish it so I can send a link instead of hashing it out in an email or text thread. Twitter was built as a MicroBlogging service. Microblogging as a type of broadcast medium was the forerunner to social networking platforms. Social networking existed from the moment the first network computer connections were made. Twitter had a good name and was the best breed of something not unique amongst the landscape at the time. The fundamentals of Twitter already existed elsewhere. The Twitter idea originated from Odeo4,5, a podcasting company. It was just a means of having an SMS group chat. Evan Williams created Blogger which was sold to Google and was the basis of the ideas behind both podcasting and blogging. Before Twitter, social media meant connecting with others online primarily through email and RSS, both of which could be read from the same client and in a browser. Some folks worked out unique ways to notify others via email for pingbacks and trackbacks6. I was a fan of Friendfeed because it supported pulling feeds from various sources. Facebook acquired it for $15 million and shut it down7. Similarly, Pump.io, StatusNet, and identi.ca were using the open-source Activity Streams format which was a precursor to the ‘Fediverse’ or federated social network terms tossed around today. Inter-Net-work….the web was inherently social long before the media part. In Silicon Valley’s race to capitalize, proprietary methodologies were created because open standards hinder income potential. Even the data archive I got from Twitter last week isn’t exactly portable. The WC3, who sets the stand has recommended Web Mentions, Activity Streams, and Activity Pub9 standards which is the protocol that makes Mastodon federated. I migrated most of my Twitter follows over to Mastadon while I was at it last week. Watching the other platforms pivot to gain new users is amusing. Substack has added ‘mentions’, ’cross-posts’, and ‘best seller’ badges10. Tumblr rolled out a $7 badge and the owner insisted they would be implementing the activitypub specification which I noted appropriately11. I’m sure folks will figure out a way to spam those protocols too as long as there is a way to profit from them. Twitter turned to bots after it gained popularity and the account APIs were introduced. The bot, spam, link farms, etc were online long before Twitter too. Elon Musk recently tweeted “Vox Populi, Vox Dei” likely in reference to his surveys on reinstating previously banned accounts. It translates to the “Voice of the People is the Voice of God”, but the full context of the most cited reference to that term is: Nec audiendi qui solent dicere, Vox populi, vox Dei, quum tumultuositas vulgi semper insaniae proxima sit. “ And those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness. ~ Alcuin in his letters to Charlamagne Epistle 127 in 760AD12. The riotousness of the crowd is Twitter. And Twitter is just a bellwether for the internet as a whole as we adapt to new communications mediums. Those first couple of years were just techie types tweeting because those were most of the same folks with websites. Then came the journalists, media, celebrities, publishers, and internet celebrities. Then everyone’s uncle had it installed on their phone. When those other folks started rambling on about their other interests, I lost interest. And then they started to monetize it all with adverts, tracking users across the web, and rewriting shared URLs so they could track those too. The most retweeted thing ever was a pyramid scheme offering a reward for retweets. The web was already decentralized and will likely always be outside some platforms’ walled gardens. I just hope that the efforts to improve the open standards aren’t sabotaged by private interests. I’m sure in the coming year we’ll end up hearing a lot more on free speech and social media. I have a very simple minded approach to it which I wrote about pretty extensively in my article on Section 23013. I think that you’re welcome to espouse your opinions, ideas, or theories however you’d like but not entirely without consequence if they are damanging to others. I think that the main product of social media platforms, aside from usability, is sorting and moderating that information so that it’s vaulable to it’s end users. A platform like Twitter is a private company and can make itself reponsible for moderation however it best see’s fit to it’s own business model. And likewise, I can excersize my own liberty to not pay it any attention. I’d use social media again if I had something to promote and I suppose I’m lucky not to have the need. Former Twitter CEO Evan Williams apologized saying he was “wrong to think that an open platform where people could speak freely would make the world a better place”. I wouldn’t completely agree with him on that because I believe there have been some good things gained through social networking platforms. I read an essay recently fed to me, not via social media but my handy dandy good ole’ fashion hosted RSS reader… entitled A Tweet Before Dying that said “What then? We’ll all move over to some Twitter replacement like Mastodon, hundreds of millions of us, and ruin that too? Sigh.”13. Other than echoing my sentiments here, whatever happens with Twitter means very little to me because I choose to rely not on the platform itself but on the interoperable standards of the internet which were social from the get go. 2022/12/03 Update: Right on Cue… Matt Taibbi, the investigative journalist published a series of tweets he’s calling the Twitter Files15 yesterday afternoon looking into the content moderation efforts of Twitter during the last election. Main takeaway for me was the fact that, imagine this… people are sending emails around requesting removals and questioning various policies. Sometimes just having an audience has it’s own consequences. @windhamdavid tweets – https://davidawindham.com/til/lists/tweets @windhamdavid follows – https://davidawindham.com/til/lists/people#i-follow-on-twitter Windham, D. 2020.

Since my day job involves sitting hours behind a computer monitor, the best time for me to get it done is when the weather isn’t that great outside. It’s been raining almost all weekend here and I tend to enjoy working then. It’s also about this time of year when I like to remind myself why I enjoy my work which often involves learning something new or delving into a fun side project. One project that’s kinda been lingering in my mind for the last several years is related to broadcasting. It was brought up recently in a text thread between some friends because I grew up around broadcasting. My family spent the vast majority of their careers in radio and I hosted a nighttime radio show for a couple of years. My father also had an advertising agency and had suggested I study design in college to help me take over the agency. I slipped into web development while I was there and the agency is long gone. The older I get, the more realistic I’ve become in terms of who I am. Although I’ve tried not to let my work define who I am, the bulk of my experience as a developer has relied on the evolution of the web as a medium. Although the illusion of some sort of computer code wizardry might make my job seem fanciful, it could also be described as a net jockey which would more closely link me to the family business. I’ve always looked at the web as a type of broadcast medium and a net jockey is just using a different medium powered by computer networks. The medium is the message1 no matter the jockey. I believe that a large part of my father and uncle’s success was deeply tied to the timing of the evolution of FM radio. On a bunch of occasions, they’ve told me stories of how they went around to every car dealer in the region convincing them to order new cars with FM radios installed, sometimes with an offer to trade out promotion. Likewise, a fella named Gary Parsons2 who lived right up the road from where I grew up in South Carolina disc jockeyed a night show and later founded XM Satellite Radio which was the first satellite radio broadcaster in the U.S. It wasn’t until General Motors bought in that in dash satellite receivers started being offered in automobiles. He’s adapted to new technologies and is now working on geolocating network users. The people who influenced my father were folks like John Richbourg3, also a South Carolina native, who became the model for others like Wolfman Jack. He became famous jockeying from WLAC4 in Nashville when, in the early 50s the station bumped up to 50,000 watts with a directional antenna that could reach the majority of the east coast and midwestern states especially at night. Many music historians credit these nightly shows as the foundation of rock and roll. The station was acquired by Scripps several years back and has become a backbone of the sensational talk radio crowd which reminds me that I learned very early on to distrust broadcasted information. In about third grade or so I heard my father talking on the radio one morning about going to dinner the night before with his family. Since I knew we hadn’t gone there to eat, I couldn’t understand how he could lie to others while insisting I never do it. I asked my mom why, to which she replied with “ask your father”. Although I don’t think I ever did, it brought down the third or fourth wall5 rather quickly and I became suspect of all advertising while learning to differentiate performance from reality. It always reminds me of this scene in American Graffiti6. The term disc jockey was abandoned sometime in the 80s in favor of radio personality. The etymology of the word jockey7 is actually pretty derogatory. It’s more closely related to jockstrap than horse or disc jockey. Although originally appearing as the Scottish version of the name John, it became associated with horse dealers, riders, minstrels and vagabonds. It became synonymous with a trickster, hence the verb jockey to ‘outwit’ or ‘out do’. It was used as a slang term for a penis and subsequently used to define a prostitutes client. It was first applied to radio broadcasting by Walter Winchell8 in 1935 to slander his competitor. Winchell was notoriously brutal and several documentaries have been made largely focused on how power corrupts the influence of ‘the media’. For years, many folks were very surprised to learn that the disc jockeys on WLAC who had ushered in the era of rock and roll were actually white. Needless to say, the internet has set the jockeys loose in the derogatory sense of the word. Everyone has become their own public relations agents promo’ing themselves and anything someone will pay for. Most are still lying to sell you something, sensationalizing, propagandizing, blurring their identities, bending reality, and using the equivalent of modern sound effects. Neil Young wrote in 1983, “the schemes of today would make Alan Freed9 look like a saint”. Payola10 never went away, it’s just in an entirely different form. I can’t see any end in sight as I watch the young folks navigate the web. The new La La Lands are factories in China where live streamers work from scripts selling anything you can imagine. The New York Times did a documentary entitled Inside the Daily Life of a Live Streaming Star in China11 which is a fascinating modern study on the incredible machine that net jockeying has become. TikTok is now a record label and OnlyFans produces films. The rise of ‘influencers’ alongside the medium is just the same album on repeat. As Twitter changed hands this last week, I couldn’t help but wonder about the future of medium since I had logged on the week they began. Elon Musk is just another jockey, albeit a form closer to that of Howard Hughes11 or Henry Ford12. He’s just jockeying the new spruce goose or horseless carriage in the form of online payments and electric motors. The Twitter acquisition might end up resembling Ford’s purchase of the Dearborn Independent. I’ve now spent enough time behind the curtains online to know how small the wizard really is. E-commerce has finally overtaken adult content just last year. Jockeying yourself into the lead using technology isn’t anything new and I think Elon is going to struggle with this one in the long term since the underlying technology isn’t really anything proprietary. Although he complained about the bots, the pay to play model alongside other content monetization will just serve to amplify the inattentiveness13. If you’d like to join the choir, please know that the ‘void is full’14. About a decade ago, my father wrapped up his last radio stint hosting a morning show for the nations largest broadcasting network. He liked to joke about how the morning drive time slot was a ‘captive audience’. At some point, I’ll try to archive some old broadcasts and I sometimes wonder how I can help the legacy without having to be a jockey. Quite frankly, growing up around it always made me want to avoid the spotlight. I’ve had the luxury remaining relatively behind the scenes and turning away work I cannot personally support. I avoid self promotion in favor of burying my name in the source code in case I need to prove my credentials elsewhere. Although I’ve manage to acquire the knowledge skillset to do so, this here net jockey has preferred to play the wizard. I’ll just set up a multi-platform syndication and broadcasting server for my colleagues and stay behind the curtains. As of now, I think I’ve made a wise choice because there is a lot of freedom in relative anonymity even though I’ve never been afraid to voice my opinion. If I ever decide that I want to make it about personal clicks, views, likes, audience share, or feel I have an important message… I’ll likely use a pseudonym, pen, or stage name so there is no way you could bet the jockey and not the horse. I put this here because it makes me look like a jockey with the number and all… It’s from the BASC ( Bicycle Across South Carolina ) event.

Windham Portland We recently traveled to Portland to visit family. I’d previously visited the city alongside Eugene and Salem some years ago and was excited to see them again. Since I had driven the McKenzie River Highway across the eastern part of the state to Idaho, we focused on the western Pacific coast traveling through the Tillamook State Forest 1. During our trip we had a chance to explore a good swath of the Oregon Coast Highway and we took a day trip to visit some of the early wineries in the Willamette Valley 2. We went downtown for walking, dining and shopping mainly in the Pearl district. We toured around the rest by car. We stayed in Beaverton and toured around there a bit taking a look at the neighborhoods, businesses, Intel, and Nike. We visited the Japanese Gardens and Aboretum in Washington Park 3. They were nice and quiet. Oregon is undoubtably a very beautiful state with a diverse geography and Portland is quite a unique place. Instead of the typical travelogue, what really spurred this essay was the fact that we had had the Portland Art Museum on our agenda, but we never made it. On my tours, I made it a point to hit the east side neighborhoods stopping in for lunch and using the city’s homeless encampment data dashboard for a grittier tour of the city 4. While circling the block to try and find parking downtown, one of Portland’s finest tried to wave us down and then punched our car while yelling obscenities at us. I was so ticked off, I just headed back over to the suburbs of Beaverton and went bowling instead. It’s a shame because I really enjoy visiting art museums. Portland has become a flashpoint. Most of it was brought on by the coverage of the federal intervention during the 2020 protests, but Portland has a long history of both far-right and left-wing groups 5. Antifa as most people might have heard about it in the U.S. was largely a reference to the first use of the word in the U.S. by the Rose City Antifa mainly in response to rise of the alt-right groups who had been gaining momentum in the area 6. During the first presidential debate with Biden, Trump bragged about sending in U.S. Marshals and started his whole skit which crescendoed with Antifa being reponsible for the Capital Riots. I am not going ad hominem on this because I think there is a deeper story. While driving through the Tillamook State Forest, I asked if anyone had seen the movie Sometimes a Great Notion based on the book by Ken Kesey 7,8. In it, Paul Newman plays a gyppo logger who straps Henry Fonda’s severed arm giving the finger to the front of his logging boat while union busting. It’s really a story about the rugged obstinance that still exists in the Pacific northwest and likely a remnant of the pioneer past. It’s worth a watch, Universal Films published it without a paywall, and I’ve skipped to that exact spot @ https://youtu.be/0zaYvGNLpzM?t=6759 Hank Pander died the weekend we returned from Portland 9. He won the 1961 Prix de Rome Silver Medal and created a significant volume of work. He considered himself an American outsider having moved to Portland from Amsterdam and having lived through the Nazi occupation of Holland during his childhood. I’ve included two of his paintings below. He painted several large format pieces on the 2020 Portland Protests 10. I’ve included a painting below from 2021 entitled Lament ( Siege of Caffa ) 11. The subject is about the Black Plague, the most fatal pandemic in history which created social, religious, and economic turmoil changing the course of European history. The bird mask and stick are associated with doctors who lined the mask with herbs to sanitize the air and used the stick to avoid contact to the disease. The Mongols used catapults to launch plague-infested corpses of the dead soldiers over the fortified walls of Caffa in what is considered one of the first acts of biological warfare. 2021 was the year in which Covid cases in the U.S. tripled and the US Capital Riots took place. Hank Pander – 2021 “Lament (Siege of Caffa)” – Oil on Linen 60×81 The images of rioting in Portland became synonomous with the social upheaval of the 2020 elections. There are numerous reasons, but here is mine. Portland is a frontier town and those towns like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle have a long history of social strife which I believe is related to them being some of the last of the modern frontier. They are also full of modern day explorers, some of whom unfortunately end up drug-addled and homeless. Gus Van Sant went to high school in Portland and one of his first films, Drugstore Cowboy tackled drug addiction 11. Social welfare and homelessness are a problem in Portland. In recent years, the pressure of competition for resources have driven housing costs and I believe that competition for resources is the primary catalyst for creating a boiler pot of extremism on both sides. The people of Portland are not just Portlandia. They’re more akin to the pioneer decendents of the Oregon Trail and the obstinant gyppo loggers in Sometimes a Great Notion. The competition for resources drives the extremes and is sometimes a catalyst for great art. The existing social strife alongside the effects of Covid just served to illustrate a darker side of human condition. On the flight out to Portland, my wife and I played a modern version of the game Oregon Trail 12,13 which I had grown up playing on floppy discs and monochrome monitors. Portland started its life as a pioneer destination of desputed territory of the British and still perfectly represents the frontier expansion of the United States. The game is all about surviving the grueling emigrant wagon trail to the American west. In my opinion, the reality of frontier wagon trail life still persists in some areas of the U.S. We died in the game from exhaustion and dysentary and had to restart it to finish on the flight home. Maybe next go round, I’ll have a chance to visit the art museum and see some of Hank Pander’s paintings.

Windham Artificial Intelligence ( Part 2 ) I previously wrote a quick essay about artificial intelligence1 in which I took a fairly skeptical viewpoint on the usage of the term and I was partially wrong. It happens. Although I make some decent points in the first essay, I made some updates to it and I wanted to follow up on it with some additional comments. And based on the potential, this will likely become an ongoing topic. The main change in my viewpoint came from using the Khanmigo2 bot available from Khan Academy. It clearly shows how powerful natural language processing can be for acquiring knowledge. I’ve always had the viewpoint that AI is essentially just a fake term for describing how programming is used to do something like play chess or search a database. My main focus was not on how we use these tools, but on the tools themselves. Even though I hinted at this when I started using the term a ‘second brain’3 to describe a personal knowledge management system, I wasn’t fully convinced of using the term artificial intelligence. Aside from testing Khanmigo, I learned to use the OpenAI ChatGPT-4 API against my own documents this morning. Here I am asking it some questions: I had previously only used AI with CoPilot for code completion and just toying around with LLMs ( Large Language Models ) for fun. Now I’m paying for them. The best analogy I can use to describe the ability to train models is to compare it to automotive repair. All modern cars already use OBD (onboard diagnostics ) and there are tools that can read these codes. Although there are some standards, each manufacturer can specify additional codes. The average automobile owner has neither the OBD scanner tool to read the codes nor the manufacturer’s code reference. Since automobiles have circuits like computers, the obvious first use of AI was for programming code. That’s where AI, using natural language processing and machine learning against large language models steps in. Now imagine if you could simply press a button and ask your car what is wrong and how to fix it without intermediary tools and steps. AI will be able to do this for almost all professional fields in the coming years since we use language for knowledge. I think my prior hangup with using the term intelligence is that it infers a capacity for awareness and not just knowledge. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is already passing the majority of legal, medical, and business exit exams. My wife is asking me to review her college student essays because she believes some are using AI to write them. I’ve never questioned the value of assisted learning using a knowledge base or other programming tools, but now that I’ve had the chance to apply the same AI tools to my own documents, I can clearly see a path forward for AI-assisted technologies in almost every field of practice. It’s not necessarily coming for your jobs, but it will change how you do them. You can either adapt or be left in the dust. While other people will fear what they don’t understand4,5,6,7, I’m all in. The most practical application for me will be feeding databases and files into training models so that I can improve the typical little help bot feature to be able to process more robust natural language queries. I don’t think I’ll be building or training the models for machine learning, but in the tradition of John Henry8, I’ll still try give it my best to ‘out-intelligence’ them. John Henry said to his captain, “A man is nothing but a man, But before I let your steam drill beat me down, I’d die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord, I’d die with a hammer in my hand.” 23/04/26 – I saw a press piece recently citing a paper that had studied the sources used in AI and guess what?

It’s an interesting phrase that has been used for books, movies, albums, television series, and other titles. I think what’s interesting about it is that defining life has perplexed science, religion, and philosophy. Since there is no consensus on a definition of life, it’s only descriptives of how we interpret it. Life is a process and hundreds of definitions of life have been compiled3. I also happened to watch a recent episode of The Simpsons last night entitled “Bartless” ( #743 Season 34, Episode 15 ) that uses the ‘what if’ our lives had been inextricably altered. In this case, it was life without Bart and was written by John Frink, the character Professor Frink is named after4,5. And so I think that life as we know it can only be described as “Oh my god particle mw-hai, hoyvin glavin”! https://LifeAsWeKnowIt.com Woozie – https://davidawindham.com/woozie/ Life – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life John Frink – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frink Professor Frink – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Frink ← Woozie Artificial Intelligence ( Part 2 ) →","metadata":{"source":"https://davidawindham.com/life-as-we-know-it/","title":"Life As We Know It","date":"2023-03-08T13:43:33-05:00","contentLength":269}},{"pageContent":"2/26/2023 David A. Windham Woozie I migrated the server this site sits on last week and said goodbye to one of my longest-running servers alongside of my favorite provider. And although this likely means very little to some of you, I take a good bit of pride in my approach to maintaining servers. I named the new server Woozie after a former pet like I always do1. I enjoy sys-admin’ing. I like the security aspects, monitoring the logs, automating various processes, and seeing how small a memory footprint I can run. Or perhaps it’s just the egomaniac power of being the root user. I’ve set up a bunch of servers over the years and every time I spin up a new server, I always learn something new and get a little better at it. The internet is like a giant neighborhood and I’m just trying to keep my yard tidy. I got the basics rolling to migrate and watched the server logs closely. There were 27 reboots, hundreds of lines of configuration changes and 82,145 requests served last week. The webserver is doing 10,000 requests at about 500 per second, 2.5 milsec per, in about 20 seconds ( see video below ). Linode2, my provider on this machine was acquired by Akamai3 last year for $900 million. I was and still am, as of now, an avid Linode supporter. It was just something about the little old bank building in Philidelphia that made them feel like an underdog. Akamai is in Cambridge Mass, the closest thing to an east coast silicon valley, sitting right up under MIT just like Google and Microsoft. The transition has been smooth thus far and I can only hope that they’ll give me the ability to easily plug into their existing edge network with some build tools4. Back when I first started making websites, I used an assortment of low-level hosting providers before working my way up the food chain. I’ve since worked on variously flavored machines across the spectrum of providers. I prefer to just admin the servers hourly so I don’t feel like a petty middleman hosting dealer. I have a distaste for constantly revisiting documentation so the cloud infrastructure at AWS and Google can be tiresome for most projects. I still like root access even for noSQL, flat files, or an external API data source. I like the ability to monitor all of the server and end-user traffic. There are definitely benefits to serverless edge networks and decoupled computing instances, but I’ve found that serving up an assortment of sites with mostly regional appeal doesn’t warrant the effort, complexity, or price tag. But let’s be clear on this since the term serverless is making the rounds… there are still mostly Linux servers underneath them all, you’re just not in control of them. Cloud systems can still be private and function like the big providers using orchestration tools like Kubernetes6. My service provider for this migration offers a managed Kubernetes product that’s relatively easy to use. Companies that once were trying to get you in their cloud are now offering racks-as-a-service. The key to using orchestration tools is having standardization between deployments. Even Chick-fil-A restaurants now have on-site computers Kubernetes7. I don’t use middleware to admin servers unless I have to on the provider side. I strip it down to the bare minimum so that it’s easier to keep running for a long time. I’ve got a couple web UIs to quickly scan logs and search databases. I remove all password access to users, obfuscate the default ports, lockdown the others with iptables, and run blocks at the webserver level. Aside from some of the default Linux packages, I use a couple languages, a couple databases, webservers, and some tools to restart other processes. I learned a lot new stuff about logrotate.d and cron as I tried to automate some new tasks. The deprecated server had been running at Linode for almost ten years. Not necessarily on the same hardware because I’m sure that the data center moves them around as necessary. It started off running Ubuntu Server v14.04 back in 2014 and I ran it up until v18.04 which is running into an End of Life this April. I upgraded it to v20.04 and could have kept it going much longer, but I was getting tired of cleaning out the cruft and customizing outdated packages. Plus, I just wanted a clean slate on the configuration on a new development server. Simple is the key to my approach. If I don’t need it, I remove or block it. I’ve documented the entire server setup @ https://davidawindham.com/til/docs/computers/woozie8.

Windham Grocery Shopping I went grocery shopping this morning. It could be that I was thinking about food because I had an upset stomach from the spicy pork ramen I had yesterday out of town. I usually try to slide into the grocery stores very early on Tuesday mornings since it seems quiet, but I couldn’t get away from my desk this week. I shop at Publix1 and Lidl2 weekly and hit Trader Joe’s3 and/or Whole Foods4 about every other month since they’re a 45-minute drive. I think we spend $200 per week and my wife says $300 so I’m sure it’s somewhere between the two. Sources indicate that we’re not exactly on the thrifty side with the average for two coming in at $800 per month in 2022. Since I spent the majority of last week analyzing technical workflows, I just kinda wanted to tune up my grocery get’n game and share how I do it. Before I left this morning, I asked the better half to do the list. She still keeps a whiteboard and markers on the fridge and in the mud room while I keep a shared running Notes ( Apple )5 document using clickable task lists and sections. You just tap the items you need and they sort themselves so it’s easy to have em up on your phone in the store. Here’s that list from the past couple of months sans household and medicine items: ProduceCoolerPantry Freezer– Garlic– Beef– Honey– Pizza– Spinach– Shrimp– Coffee– Frozen Bananas– Asparagus– Chicken– Tea– Palak paneer– Tomatoes– Cheese– Oil– Ice Cream– Onion– Vegan Meat – Sunflower Oil– Lasagna– Lemons– Yogurt – Olive Oil– Fish– Avocados– Butter – Sesame– Burritos– Blueberries– Keifer– Mustard– Beyond Sausage– Romaine– Beer– Mayo– Tuna Burgers– Brussel sprouts– Milk– Dressing– Pinapple– Cucumbers – Oat– Pickles– Salmon Burgers– Broccoli – Almond– Olives– Paella – Oranges – Cow– Artichoke– French fries– Peppers – Soy– Pasta Sauce– Calamari– Green Onion– Juice– Mac & Cheese– Shrimp– Cilantro – Cherry– Pasta– Scallops– Lemongrass – Cranberrry– Oatmeal– Pad Thai– Basil – Grapefruit– Cereal– Enchilladas– Carrots– Biscuits– Peanut butter– Quinoa blend– Celery– Cheese– Chocolate– Corn– Ginger – Swiss– Crackers– Peas– Bean sprouts – Cheddar– Granola Bars– Plantains– Sprouts – Parmesan– Bread– Pieriogis– Mixed greens– Salsa– Curry– Blueberries– Bananas– Fish– Chips– Potatoes – Salmon– Rice– Apples – Cod– Quinoa– Lime – Tuna– Canned Soup– Mushrooms – Haddock – Chili– Green Beans – Orange Roughy– Canned Beans– Carrots– Eggs – Black– Nuts– Sigis – Garbanzo – Cashew– Tofu – Kidney – Almond – Peas – Sunflower– Canned Fish – Pistachios Not too shabby… you are what you eat. I was at a friends house last weekend out of town who I hadn’t seen in a while and I asked if I could look through his fridge and pantry for exactly this reason. I was at my mom’s last week and complained about her shopping habits as it’s related to health. Aside from sleeping, eating and cooking is coming in right behind work being done to pay for those groceries. I love food and we like to cook, so we rarely dine out. I asked my doctor once why, when I eat healthy and exercise regularly do I seem to gain weight to which he said “because you’re getting old and you probably eat too much” gently explaining portion control. I’m not a food snob nor a slouch. I like how good food makes me feel. I’m experienced enough to know decent cuisine and lowbrow enough to eat a deer perlo that my drunk neighbor had been simmering for two days. I got my first bag of Hot Takis on the road last week. I liked em. I occasionally drink a glass of wine or beer with dinner. I try to order directly from the vintner or brewer whenever possible and I’ll do the same with my food given the option. I noticed during the height of Covid that we were eating differently mainly because we were not shopping in person or ordering online. If you order in advance or go into the store with a list, you tend to think differently about your food. I’m not so organized that I plan meals or take the instant fun out of haphazardly grocery shopping. We have an outdoor market in town, but the vendor selection is still rather limited especially out of season. I’ve noticed that some of the products in Lidl are the same as Trader Joes’ and the prices aren’t far off from one another. I’d say that over half of most grocery stores are just plain shite. Corn syrup, puffed, flaked, canned, bagged premade shite. And I’d imagine that at least 80% of them are coming from just about ten companies. For whatever reason, grocery shopping makes me feel like I’m doing something right. Like the basis of all survival is hunting and gathering at my LED-lit big metal building with a vague music selection and lots of folks moving stuff around. Although it’d be nice to imagine the farm to mid-week outdoor market meeting my food needs, it’s not. The American supermarket is an icon of postmodernism… the Warhol soup cans or the ending credits of White Noise6.

Windham Human Updates Available I keep a list of short, middle, and long-term reminders on all of my devices that I use regularly1. Although I’m constantly editing the short-term list and the long-term has items that have been on there for years. The middle list seems to always have items that take longer than a couple of days because I’m not getting paid or rewarded for doing them. For instance, there’s one titled ‘Garage Floodlight’ because I needed some extra light in the yard when I was taking our dog outside in the evenings. I bought the wiring, fixtures, and switches to install I just haven’t carved out a weekend to make it happen. Another item on my middle-term list is upgrading one of my servers to the more recent version of Linux. I have this shuffling technique I’ve been using over the years with servers, software, and programming languages where I like to keep three tiers in running. I always keep one running way out in front on a beta version, one on the current long-term support version, and then there is usually one that needs to be updated usually because it has some legacy feature requiring a rewrite. This is exactly how I handle my servers so that I can shuffle applications between them as needed. I’ve been calculating some time near the beginning of this year to spend on upgrading and it’s got me thinking that I should be applying that same approach to my own knowledge and skillset on occasion too. It’s time to dust out some useless brain cells to try and pack in some new information. Just reformat, pile in some new architecture, and reboot I’m generally a late adopter2 because I like the comfort of the middle and I joke in my Github bio that I “still haven’t learned Rust”3. Although I kinda enjoy being able to work in a bunch of frameworks as the master of none, during the last several years I’ve found myself using just several stacks to accomplish anything with the vast majority of my code being copied and pasted from project to project. Because I’m focused mostly on smaller-scale projects, I don’t have to dive into machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science visualizations. I’ve got enough programming chops, cloud and network security experience to bring a project to scale, but it’s rarely needed. I understand and enjoy them, I just don’t have any real motive to acquire and analyze large data sets or scale a project to millions of users. And when I say motive, I generally mean money. A lot of folks may not realize it, but the underlying motives for many technology decisions are money in the form of security, network, and energy usage. Users generate revenue either through advertising, subscriptions, or purchases. Serving up quadrillions of lines of code hourly to billions of users takes energy in the form of electricity sent to computers for processing power. Optimizing how efficient and secure the code is saves money in the form of maintenance, energy, and network usage. Programming languages are only being used to make calculations and database modifications, databases are being abstracted in APIs to reduce calls, file formats for media have shifted to the most efficient and graphics have moved to being served in line with code. For instance, when a page from say Facebook is loaded into your app or browser they’re generally using JavaScript to query and pull in information that is changing from an API so that it is efficient. Their React library to do so has become one of the most dominant in web development. I’ve built most of my career on JavaScript and I can empathize with those trying to take in all of the frameworks today. Even a very simple website developer has to have a pretty robust understanding to customize the editors in the most common content management systems. It’s pretty difficult to keep up. Recently Shopify acquired Remix4 for React and Vercel announced a new build tool called Turbo5 that is built in Rust6. Although seemingly large changes have taken place since I started in the early 2000s, the basic underlying browsers have remained the same up until 2020 when WebAssembly7 (WASM) became the fourth officially supported browser language behind HTML, CSS, and JavaScript8. JavaScript is going anywhere and will likely keep its spot on the front end, it’s just that web assembly is much faster and safer allowing lower-level programming languages like C, GoLang, and Rust to work in the browser at near-native efficiency. The reason that Rust is picking up steam against the others is that it’s memory safe. I’d venture to say that the vast majority of the hacking out there starts with memory leaks. I’m going to have to dive into WASM sooner than later. And without any client motivation, I’m just going to have to invent a project or dive into someone else’s so that I can learn to find uses for it. I think I’ll start with the Rust WASM9 and Black Hat Rust10. So aside from packing that new information in, I think I’ll also add a permanent middle-term reminder that there are human upgrades available. Although there may be various reasons why I’ve been relatively successful in my professional life, I think the core is that I enjoy learning and adapting to changes. It’s an approach that can be applied not only to your profession but also to your personal development. We’re upgradeable in so many other ways than just our professional life… just pile in some new architecture and reboot.

Windham 2022 in Review It seems that about his time every year, I’m looking to clean up, put a nice little bow on it, and start the new year fresh. I’m trying to get ahead of the little bit of traveling we do for the holidays. In the process, I just re-read the last year-end essay I wrote in 20191. I think a year in review post would make a good tradition and an easy way for me to share with others. And in that regard, I’ll try to keep it brief. 2022 started bumpy with my brother, our dog, and Ginny’s grandmom all dying within the span of a couple of months. That put me in just a general fog of reconciliation and reminiscing for the first part of the year2,3,4. I gained the most from those events to grow as a person. I could go on here at great lengths about this, but the most important aspect I was reminded of is that the life we know is fleeting. I’ve always kinda felt that way, but it’s nice to have a reminder every so often to keep your priorities in perspective. By midyear, I was back to joking about it. I’d finish lunch or tennis with someone and say “If I don’t ever see you again, it was nice knowing you” which got some interesting looks and responses, especially from the older folks. We skipped our normal winter getaway likely because we were just tired from dealing with those but I made up for it on a couple of other trips in the spring. I got a cabin up in the hills with some old friends which spurred on a couple of other gatherings and potentially an annual event5,6. I saw Dylan for the first, and likely last time7. I went to see an old friend whose outdoor concert got canceled from lightning, so we just got to hang out. We also did a couple of tennis tournaments and participated in my first cycling event. Being around kind people in really nice environments is a great reminder of how fun life can be. Work this year was dominated by relatively short contracts. This is rewarding because I get quick positive feedback on them, but I don’t enjoy shifting my attention around. That’s likely why I wrote two essays8,9 on staying organized and it could be why I almost ended up in another full-time position. I replied to a recruiter’s email and ended up in a month-long interview process. I remember a long pause from the hiring manager right after I said something to the extent of “I need to have some flexibility with my schedule because I like to play tennis in the mornings and I coach tennis in the afternoons”. Needless to say, I talked myself out of a six-figure salary which, although seemingly impractical, will likely work out for the best. Ginny is simultaneously taking on a new leadership role and finishing a doctorate program at Clemson10. She will be defending and graduating next summer. I’ve tried to spend some extra time with my parents this year because they won’t live forever. I discovered the rewards of coaching kids after I became the head coach of the high school tennis teams. I finally ditched my old truck since the transmission was going and got a new ride11. I’ve also accepted that I need to carry my reading glasses into the grocery store so I can read the expiration dates. I spent part of this year on a vegan diet until the cheese cravings kicked in. And like every other new year’s resolution, I’d like to prioritize my mind and body the best I’m able to compensate for the aging. I’m starting the new year by turning 50 which I’ve been saying I was for some time now12. I’m not planning a party because, in my mind, I’m not over the hill quite yet even though I’m getting close. I couldn’t convince the better half to let me rehab an old classic convertible but I did get permission to turn our den into a studio so I’d like do some of the woodworking for the cabinetry, re-learn the piano, and take up watercolor painting. I am planning on doing the deep dive on the Rust and Web Assembly early next year to keep up to date with work. I think my boy’s tennis team will have a winning season this spring. Ginny and I are planning on remodeling the kitchen later in the fall and we’ll likely take a long break post-graduation to stroll up the west coast to celebrate her hard work. Otherwise, I’m just going to try and make it long enough to write another one of these next year. Best wishes to y’all out there and I hope you have a happy new year. Be well, do good work, & keep in touch13 , David 2019 in Review – https://davidawindham.com/2019-2/ Kristopher Roland Windham – https://davidawindham.com/kristopher-roland-windham/ Zeke – https://davidawindham.com/zeke/ Old Photos – https://davidawindham.com/old-photos/ Jocassee – https://davidawindham.com/jocassee/ Cold Mountain – https://davidawindham.com/cold-mountain/ Bob Dylan – https://davidawindham.com/bob-dylan/ Slow Thinking – https://davidawindham.com/slow-thinking/ A Second Brain – https://davidawindham.com/a-second-brain/ Gast, G.

Windham Twitter I logged in the first time soon after it started in 2007. I did my ten years and then mostly logged off by 2017. I’m not likely to start using it again regularly although I still use it occasionally as a people bookmarking service of sorts. I logged in last week to get an ‘archive’ of all of my data and publish it elsewhere1,2. I tweeted 828 times and based on the IDs in the data, I’m guessing that I was the 950,535th person to ever tweet. The process felt achingly familiar3. I’ve had some discussions with others about it recently and it reminds me to think about how I use the web. Per the course… I like to flush it out, write it down, and publish it so I can send a link instead of hashing it out in an email or text thread. Twitter was built as a MicroBlogging service. Microblogging as a type of broadcast medium was the forerunner to social networking platforms. Social networking existed from the moment the first network computer connections were made. Twitter had a good name and was the best breed of something not unique amongst the landscape at the time. The fundamentals of Twitter already existed elsewhere. The Twitter idea originated from Odeo4,5, a podcasting company. It was just a means of having an SMS group chat. Evan Williams created Blogger which was sold to Google and was the basis of the ideas behind both podcasting and blogging. Before Twitter, social media meant connecting with others online primarily through email and RSS, both of which could be read from the same client and in a browser. Some folks worked out unique ways to notify others via email for pingbacks and trackbacks6. I was a fan of Friendfeed because it supported pulling feeds from various sources. Facebook acquired it for $15 million and shut it down7. Similarly, Pump.io, StatusNet, and identi.ca were using the open-source Activity Streams format which was a precursor to the ‘Fediverse’ or federated social network terms tossed around today. Inter-Net-work….the web was inherently social long before the media part. In Silicon Valley’s race to capitalize, proprietary methodologies were created because open standards hinder income potential. Even the data archive I got from Twitter last week isn’t exactly portable. The WC3, who sets the stand has recommended Web Mentions, Activity Streams, and Activity Pub9 standards which is the protocol that makes Mastodon federated. I migrated most of my Twitter follows over to Mastadon while I was at it last week. Watching the other platforms pivot to gain new users is amusing. Substack has added ‘mentions’, ’cross-posts’, and ‘best seller’ badges10. Tumblr rolled out a $7 badge and the owner insisted they would be implementing the activitypub specification which I noted appropriately11. I’m sure folks will figure out a way to spam those protocols too as long as there is a way to profit from them. Twitter turned to bots after it gained popularity and the account APIs were introduced. The bot, spam, link farms, etc were online long before Twitter too. Elon Musk recently tweeted “Vox Populi, Vox Dei” likely in reference to his surveys on reinstating previously banned accounts. It translates to the “Voice of the People is the Voice of God”, but the full context of the most cited reference to that term is: Nec audiendi qui solent dicere, Vox populi, vox Dei, quum tumultuositas vulgi semper insaniae proxima sit. “ And those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness. ~ Alcuin in his letters to Charlamagne Epistle 127 in 760AD12. The riotousness of the crowd is Twitter. And Twitter is just a bellwether for the internet as a whole as we adapt to new communications mediums. Those first couple of years were just techie types tweeting because those were most of the same folks with websites. Then came the journalists, media, celebrities, publishers, and internet celebrities. Then everyone’s uncle had it installed on their phone. When those other folks started rambling on about their other interests, I lost interest. And then they started to monetize it all with adverts, tracking users across the web, and rewriting shared URLs so they could track those too. The most retweeted thing ever was a pyramid scheme offering a reward for retweets. The web was already decentralized and will likely always be outside some platforms’ walled gardens. I just hope that the efforts to improve the open standards aren’t sabotaged by private interests. I’m sure in the coming year we’ll end up hearing a lot more on free speech and social media. I have a very simple minded approach to it which I wrote about pretty extensively in my article on Section 23013. I think that you’re welcome to espouse your opinions, ideas, or theories however you’d like but not entirely without consequence if they are damanging to others. I think that the main product of social media platforms, aside from usability, is sorting and moderating that information so that it’s vaulable to it’s end users. A platform like Twitter is a private company and can make itself reponsible for moderation however it best see’s fit to it’s own business model. And likewise, I can excersize my own liberty to not pay it any attention. I’d use social media again if I had something to promote and I suppose I’m lucky not to have the need. Former Twitter CEO Evan Williams apologized saying he was “wrong to think that an open platform where people could speak freely would make the world a better place”. I wouldn’t completely agree with him on that because I believe there have been some good things gained through social networking platforms. I read an essay recently fed to me, not via social media but my handy dandy good ole’ fashion hosted RSS reader… entitled A Tweet Before Dying that said “What then? We’ll all move over to some Twitter replacement like Mastodon, hundreds of millions of us, and ruin that too? Sigh.”13. Other than echoing my sentiments here, whatever happens with Twitter means very little to me because I choose to rely not on the platform itself but on the interoperable standards of the internet which were social from the get go. 2022/12/03 Update: Right on Cue… Matt Taibbi, the investigative journalist published a series of tweets he’s calling the Twitter Files15 yesterday afternoon looking into the content moderation efforts of Twitter during the last election. Main takeaway for me was the fact that, imagine this… people are sending emails around requesting removals and questioning various policies. Sometimes just having an audience has it’s own consequences. @windhamdavid tweets – https://davidawindham.com/til/lists/tweets @windhamdavid follows – https://davidawindham.com/til/lists/people#i-follow-on-twitter Windham, D. 2020.

Windham Net Jockey My schedule has been cooling down alongside the weather. Since my day job involves sitting hours behind a computer monitor, the best time for me to get it done is when the weather isn’t that great outside. It’s been raining almost all weekend here and I tend to enjoy working then. It’s also about this time of year when I like to remind myself why I enjoy my work which often involves learning something new or delving into a fun side project. One project that’s kinda been lingering in my mind for the last several years is related to broadcasting. It was brought up recently in a text thread between some friends because I grew up around broadcasting. My family spent the vast majority of their careers in radio and I hosted a nighttime radio show for a couple of years. My father also had an advertising agency and had suggested I study design in college to help me take over the agency. I slipped into web development while I was there and the agency is long gone. The older I get, the more realistic I’ve become in terms of who I am. Although I’ve tried not to let my work define who I am, the bulk of my experience as a developer has relied on the evolution of the web as a medium. Although the illusion of some sort of computer code wizardry might make my job seem fanciful, it could also be described as a net jockey which would more closely link me to the family business. I’ve always looked at the web as a type of broadcast medium and a net jockey is just using a different medium powered by computer networks. The medium is the message1 no matter the jockey. I believe that a large part of my father and uncle’s success was deeply tied to the timing of the evolution of FM radio. On a bunch of occasions, they’ve told me stories of how they went around to every car dealer in the region convincing them to order new cars with FM radios installed, sometimes with an offer to trade out promotion. Likewise, a fella named Gary Parsons2 who lived right up the road from where I grew up in South Carolina disc jockeyed a night show and later founded XM Satellite Radio which was the first satellite radio broadcaster in the U.S. It wasn’t until General Motors bought in that in dash satellite receivers started being offered in automobiles. He’s adapted to new technologies and is now working on geolocating network users. The people who influenced my father were folks like John Richbourg3, also a South Carolina native, who became the model for others like Wolfman Jack. He became famous jockeying from WLAC4 in Nashville when, in the early 50s the station bumped up to 50,000 watts with a directional antenna that could reach the majority of the east coast and midwestern states especially at night. Many music historians credit these nightly shows as the foundation of rock and roll. The station was acquired by Scripps several years back and has become a backbone of the sensational talk radio crowd which reminds me that I learned very early on to distrust broadcasted information. In about third grade or so I heard my father talking on the radio one morning about going to dinner the night before with his family. Since I knew we hadn’t gone there to eat, I couldn’t understand how he could lie to others while insisting I never do it. I asked my mom why, to which she replied with “ask your father”. Although I don’t think I ever did, it brought down the third or fourth wall5 rather quickly and I became suspect of all advertising while learning to differentiate performance from reality. It always reminds me of this scene in American Graffiti6. The term disc jockey was abandoned sometime in the 80s in favor of radio personality. The etymology of the word jockey7 is actually pretty derogatory. It’s more closely related to jockstrap than horse or disc jockey. Although originally appearing as the Scottish version of the name John, it became associated with horse dealers, riders, minstrels and vagabonds. It became synonymous with a trickster, hence the verb jockey to ‘outwit’ or ‘out do’. It was used as a slang term for a penis and subsequently used to define a prostitutes client. It was first applied to radio broadcasting by Walter Winchell8 in 1935 to slander his competitor. Winchell was notoriously brutal and several documentaries have been made largely focused on how power corrupts the influence of ‘the media’. For years, many folks were very surprised to learn that the disc jockeys on WLAC who had ushered in the era of rock and roll were actually white. Needless to say, the internet has set the jockeys loose in the derogatory sense of the word. Everyone has become their own public relations agents promo’ing themselves and anything someone will pay for. Most are still lying to sell you something, sensationalizing, propagandizing, blurring their identities, bending reality, and using the equivalent of modern sound effects. Neil Young wrote in 1983, “the schemes of today would make Alan Freed9 look like a saint”. Payola10 never went away, it’s just in an entirely different form. I can’t see any end in sight as I watch the young folks navigate the web. The new La La Lands are factories in China where live streamers work from scripts selling anything you can imagine. The New York Times did a documentary entitled Inside the Daily Life of a Live Streaming Star in China11 which is a fascinating modern study on the incredible machine that net jockeying has become. TikTok is now a record label and OnlyFans produces films. The rise of ‘influencers’ alongside the medium is just the same album on repeat. As Twitter changed hands this last week, I couldn’t help but wonder about the future of medium since I had logged on the week they began. Elon Musk is just another jockey, albeit a form closer to that of Howard Hughes11 or Henry Ford12. He’s just jockeying the new spruce goose or horseless carriage in the form of online payments and electric motors. The Twitter acquisition might end up resembling Ford’s purchase of the Dearborn Independent. I’ve now spent enough time behind the curtains online to know how small the wizard really is. E-commerce has finally overtaken adult content just last year. Jockeying yourself into the lead using technology isn’t anything new and I think Elon is going to struggle with this one in the long term since the underlying technology isn’t really anything proprietary. Although he complained about the bots, the pay to play model alongside other content monetization will just serve to amplify the inattentiveness13. If you’d like to join the choir, please know that the ‘void is full’14. About a decade ago, my father wrapped up his last radio stint hosting a morning show for the nations largest broadcasting network. He liked to joke about how the morning drive time slot was a ‘captive audience’. At some point, I’ll try to archive some old broadcasts and I sometimes wonder how I can help the legacy without having to be a jockey. Quite frankly, growing up around it always made me want to avoid the spotlight. I’ve had the luxury remaining relatively behind the scenes and turning away work I cannot personally support. I avoid self promotion in favor of burying my name in the source code in case I need to prove my credentials elsewhere. Although I’ve manage to acquire the knowledge skillset to do so, this here net jockey has preferred to play the wizard. I’ll just set up a multi-platform syndication and broadcasting server for my colleagues and stay behind the curtains. As of now, I think I’ve made a wise choice because there is a lot of freedom in relative anonymity even though I’ve never been afraid to voice my opinion. If I ever decide that I want to make it about personal clicks, views, likes, audience share, or feel I have an important message… I’ll likely use a pseudonym, pen, or stage name so there is no way you could bet the jockey and not the horse. I put this here because it makes me look like a jockey with the number and all… It’s from the BASC ( Bicycle Across South Carolina ) event.
